# Jiangxiaobei Design 

## Purpose
This is a design that I found on Dribble.com, a site for designers. 
In practicing my web development skills, I decided to recreate a similar design. This project taught me a lot about responsiveness.

In this project, I used various techniques such as grids and flexbox.
However, one of the main difficults that I had throughout this entire project was position. Sure I could have simply used position: absolute 
and move objects around, however, they made the site awkward when it came to mobile screening. In additiong, margins made it difficult to center
and line up to places that I needed it to be.

But I'm happy with my results and will perhaps come back in the future to clean it up once I learn a few more tricks.
